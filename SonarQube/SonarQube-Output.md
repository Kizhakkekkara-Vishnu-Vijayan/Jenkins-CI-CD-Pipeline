## SonarQube Output

- Following output is displayed using source code analysis with the help of checkstyle, which produces a .xml file. 
- The xml file generated by checkstyle is scanned using SonarQube Scanner and the results are displayed in the SonarQube dashboard.
- The build needs to pass through quality gate of SonarQube in order to continue the CI/CD pipeline execution.
- By default if the Bugs generated are less than 30 then the quality gate is passed.
