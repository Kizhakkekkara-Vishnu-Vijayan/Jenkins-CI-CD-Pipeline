## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline built using Jenkins to automate the build, test, code quality analysis, containerization, and deployment processes for a Java-based application.

## Project Description
The Project demonstrates how a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline integrates several tools and technologies, including Maven, SonarQube, Docker, and AWS services like ECR and ECS, to provide a robust, scalable, and automated deployment solution.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- Jenkins: Continuous integration and delivery automation.
- Maven: Build automation and dependency management.
- SonarQube: Static code analysis and quality gate enforcement.
- Docker: Containerization of the application.
- Amazon ECR: Storage for container images.
- Amazon ECS: Deployment and orchestration of containerized applications.
- Java: The applicationâ€™s programming language.

### Prerequisites
Before setting up and running the pipeline, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system:

1. Git: For cloning the repository and version control.
2. Jenkins: Installed and configured with necessary plugins like Maven, Docker, and SonarQube.
3. Maven: For building and testing the Java application.
4. SonarQube: Set up locally or via a cloud instance for code analysis.
5. Docker: Installed and running to build and manage containers.
6. AWS CLI: Configured with appropriate IAM permissions for ECR and ECS operations.
7. Java JDK: Required to compile and run the Java application.
